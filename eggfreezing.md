# My Egg Freezing Journey

I first started looking into egg freezing in 2024 but was interested it in it much earlier than that in 2019. I have always wanted kids and had concerns of fertility given I started my period at a young age (9/10 years old) & also have always had irregular periods. 

Many companies offer fertility benefits but there are differences. The first step is undeerstanding what kind of fertility treatment you want or need. Are you going in to freeze or are you trying to conceive? Are you making an embryo? Are you just retreiving eggs? Your company/insurance may only cover certain fertility treatment. 

I found out sadly that my company only covers embryo freezing. Meaning that they wlll only cover the cost of the treatment if I were to be creating embryos ( egg + sperm). I, however, have no sperm, just eggs.

Weight loss medicine have been shown to have impact on egg freezing & IVF process. Told to weight 6 months after off any of the current known medicines like wegovy & etc before going through treatment. 

I am on Qsymia, metformin & wellbutrin & was not told of any issues.
